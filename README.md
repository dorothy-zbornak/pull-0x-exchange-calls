## Running

* Note that you should specify a `--start-block`, `--since`, or `--limit` to avoid blowing your big query budget on a single unbounded query.

```bash
yarn start
    # First block to scan. Defaults to 0.
    [--start-block BLOCK_NUMBER]
    # Last block to scan. Defaults to latest.
    [--end-block BLOCK_NUMBER]
    # Minimum block time. Can be a date/time, or a natural language phrase (e.g., "yesterday").
    [--since TIME_PHRASE]
    # Maximum block time. Can be a date/time, or a natural language phrase (e.g., "now").
    [--until TIME_PHRASE]
    # Direct caller of Exchange contract. Defaults to any. Repeatable.
    [--caller ADDRESS]
    # Type of call. Defaults to all. Repeatable.
    [--call-type call | staticall | callcode | delegatecall]
    # Whether to also capture constant function calls.
    [--include-constant-functions]
    # Whether to allow internal calls (contract calling itself).
    [--allow-internal]
    # What exchange function call to capture (defaults to just mutators). Repeatable.
    # Use '!FUNCTION_NAME' to exclude a function.
    [--function FUNCTION_NAME]
    # Address of the contract being called. Defaults to v2 and v2.1 Exchange addresses. Repeatable.
    [--callee ADDRESS]
    # ABI file of the contract being called. Defaults to the Exchange ABI. Repeatable.
    [--callee-abi PATH]
    # The status of the transaction (0 for failure, 1 for success). Defaults to either. Repeatable.
    [--status 0 | 1]
    # Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to unlimited.
    [--limit NUMBER]
    # Whether to pretty-print the output.
    [--pretty]
    # File to write output JSON to. Will print to terminal otherwise.
    [--output FILE]
    # Explicitly specify Google credentials JSON file path.
    [--credentials FILE]
```
